# bip39

Implementation of a BIP39 subset that works in Node.js and modern browsers. WORK IN PROGRESS (see caveats below).

## Caveats

* Unpublished
* Most probably inefficient
* `mnemonicToBytes` doesn't validate the checksum
* Missing seed support

## TODO

* Complete code (at least checksum validation)
* Make more efficient, possibly split up in separate libraries
* Publish
